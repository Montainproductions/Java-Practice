            # Java
The point of this repository is for me to post all the diffrent java programming challenges that I do through out my life as proof of what I am capable of.
Each time I start a new challenge I will add a start time and expected end date and actual end date of the challange with a explanation of what the challenge is.

Most of my problems currently have been coming from kattis and I have slowly started to go to harder and harder problems depending on how well i felt that I had done with the previouse problems.
